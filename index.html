<div class="body-text"><p>Food prices historically change each year due to inflation, agriculture, global demand, fuel prices, geopolitical events, natural disasters, and import/export policies. According to the <a href ="https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2021/march/retail-food-price-inflation-in-2020-outpaced-historical-average-by-75-percent/"> USDA</a>, food prices historically increase at a rate of 2 percent per year. Over the course of seven years, from 2013 to 2020, the prices of most foods increased -- from 2019 to 2020, the price of beef and veal <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings/"> increased</a> by 9.6 percent, for example. But the price of fresh fruits was the only category to <a href ="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings/">decrease</a>, falling by 0.8 percent in 2020.</p></div>

<div class ="body-text"> <p> When comparing the prices of four fresh fruits over the course of seven years, from 2013 to 2020, most prices decreased or stayed the same. The USDA attributes the falling prices to supply and demand <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2021/march/retail-food-price-inflation-in-2020-outpaced-historical-average-by-75-percent/"> issues</a> due to the COVID pandemic. Countries like China, Taiwan and India are crucial points on the global produce supply chain, and COVID-related stay-at-home orders caused staffing shortages at ports, leaving a surplus of US fruit that couldn't be exported abroad. Less fruit was purchased by US restaurants (due to less patronage) and less fruit was purchased by consumers in supermarkets, who tended to prefer less perishable foods in the midst of the pandemic. Less demand for fruit meant more supply, causing prices to fall. </p></div>
